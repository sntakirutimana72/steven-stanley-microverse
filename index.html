              To begin, it helps to know what you’re looking at.
              A 3D image is one that has two different perspectives of the same image superimposed on each other.
              This is what is known as an anaglyphic image.
              By using 3D anaglyphic glasses, each eye filters chromatically opposite colors (typically red and cyan) to create a 3D eye-popping picture.
              That’s why 3D glasses have two different-colored lenses – neat, right?
